//? easiest case: n = 1, minJumps = 1

//?if (arr.length <= arr[0]) {minJumps = 1}

//set a counter to 1

//? for each number you're on....

//? currentNum > the length of the rest of the array 
//? then increment counter by one and return the counter

//? else -- recurse --- then check which of the other numbers within your jump range is the largest and jump to that one

//?switch to that max number

//? increment the counter
